This project involves a localized question-and-answer application built using the ChatGLM-6B model and relevant scripts. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

### Running ChatGLM

1. **Navigate to ChatGLM-6B Directory**  
   Change to the `ChatGLM-6B` directory, which contains the necessary files for running the ChatGLM model:

   ```bash
   cd ChatGLM-6B
   ```

2. **Start the ChatGLM Console**  
   In the `ChatGLM-6B` directory, run the following command to start the console:

   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Navigate to the Scripts Directory**  
   Depending on the version of the application you want to run, navigate to the appropriate directory under `scripts`:

   ```bash
   cd ../scripts/<desired_version>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**  
   To start the application, execute the relevant script in the `scripts` directory. For example:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

   Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you wish to execute.
